	<p>These are my favorite movies. Goodfellas is a Martin Scorcese movie and is the story of a boy in New York and how he became a mobster. The Dark Knight is a portrayal of the Batman comics by Christopher Nolan, and in this one he takes on the Joker as the main villian. The Departed is another Martin Scorcese film and depicts how the mob has been infiltrated by an undercover, while the police have been infiltrated by the mob as well.
